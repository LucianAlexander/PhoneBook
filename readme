In the API folder u can find all the scripts for the server.
In the database folder u cand find the configuration of the db used.

Current issue :
 1.delete contact;
     - on delete contact I get a message error(wrong credentials), but the contact is removed from the db, and to
     see the chage, we have to close the app and log in again.
     - delete.php seems fine, just need to check ViewContatto.java and listaPersone.java to understand the problem
 2.update contact;
     - still working on the php code;
